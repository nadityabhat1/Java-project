# Java-project
The name of this java project is 'Angel Dairy Mangement System'.It was done as a part of Object
Oriented Java Programming Course.

It basically is about a dairy management union with farmers and wholesale buyers as 
its members. The farmers sell their milk produce to the union on a daily basis to the union 
and are paid accordingly. Similarly the wholesale buyers buy certain amount of milk everyday  
from the union at fixed price.
Note: These prices are set by the union.

In the output the user(depending on whether he is a farmer or wholesale buyer) also gets the total 
amount(he would be paid or he has to pay respectively) at end of the month.

The various topics used here are:-
Concpets used are :-
1.Abstraction- Classes.
2.Scope and Lifetime of variables.
3.Declaring objects.
4.Instance Variables of different data types.
5.Constructors/Methods.
6.'this' keyword.
7.Inheritance.
8.Overloading (Constructors/Methods)
